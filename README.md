## Introduction

Sail provides a Docker powered local development experience for Harmony that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Sail. Sail's simple CLI means you can start building your Harmony application without any previous Docker experience.

#### Inspiration

Harmony Sail is inspired by and derived from [Vessel](https://github.com/shipping-docker/vessel) by [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper). If you're looking for a thorough introduction to Docker, check out Chris' course: [Shipping Docker](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker).
